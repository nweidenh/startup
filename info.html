                    Connect 4 was originally invented by Howard Wexler, but was later popularized by Milton Bradley. In addition to Milton,
                    Hasbro was one of the main companies to market and sell the Connect 4 game. 
                    Today Connect 4 is a common game among children playing for fun, and adults seeking to <b>destroy</b> their friends.
