Things to look into: How to make the pieces work on the Connect 4 gameboard.

Creating a new css file, you must include it at the top to adopt into the file

use the class = "" feature and put the name in the css file with everything you want to add to that specific feature

Use the inspect feature by right clicking on the google chrome thing you want to dive into the css on.

This may seem like a lot of work but after you do it a few times it will begin to feel natural. Just remember the main steps.

For Using Node.js
Create your project directory
Initialize it for use with NPM by running npm init -y
Make sure .gitignore file contains node_modules
Install any desired packages with npm install <package name here>
Add require('<package name here>') to your application's JavaScript
Use the code the package provides in your JavaScript
Run your code with node index.js

React Part 2
Arrow Functions can be used in place of functions to make the code more compact
Arrays are like lists and have a number of pre-programmed methods
Objects are like dictionaries, they have a number of use cases and you must do JSON when reading them
React Hooks like useEffect and useState are used to be able to do style components
Reactivity is based on states and essentailly you change the state and then tell React to update and look at the state
The Simon Repository can be a great place to get some feeling for how things work
